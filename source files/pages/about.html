          This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
          Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
          society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
          Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
          science involves the study and development of applications that allow
          for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support
          these applications, and the means and methods used to produce both
          applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and
          ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer
          programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept
          programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and the
          ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development,
          construction and maintenance of computer programs. The range of
          courses available in the department and the skills acquired by
          students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the
          economy and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working
          in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable
          the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. The course also
          provides the platform for further study or research through exposure
          to established and emerging technologies and methods, and to active
          fields of research in Computer Science. The Department offers two
          undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as
          Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
